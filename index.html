        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! I am a recent graduate of Algonquin College, holding a Diploma in Computer Programming, and
          I am eagerly seeking my inaugural role in Software Development. 
          Over the past eighteen months, I have diligently balanced both full-time employment and
          full-time academic commitments. I am now poised to apply the valuable skills
          and knowledge I have acquired throughout my program.

        <h3></h3>
        <p>After graduating High School, I began working in a warehouse driving forklift. Picking orders, offloading trailers. Until I accepted a position in the Inventory department handling customer returns. Then after 3 years working in returns, I became the Inventory Analyst. Another 3 years passed doing that role, and I became the Hold and Release / Quality Assurance Analyst.

          My dream is to become a software developer. I enjoy frontend work and hope to see myself start there. If I end up doing backend development that would be great too! 
          I like to learn new things everyday and want to keep learning. I am ready to start a new career.
          I currently practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript with this static website. I am also catching up on my PHP.
